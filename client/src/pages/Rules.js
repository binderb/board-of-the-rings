        <h2>Rules of Play</h2>
        <h4>Game Objective</h4>
        <p>
          Players are trying to get The One Ring to Mount Doom - only there can
          it be unmade! Advance through each game space by correctly answering a
          trivia question. Once you reach the final space (Mount Doom) and
          correctly answer one last question, The Ring is destroyed and you win!
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>The Game Board</h4>
        <p>
          There are twelve spaces on the board, each representing a section of
          the journey of Frodo and Samwise to Mount Doom. These spaces include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Shire</li>
          <li>Bree</li>
          <li>Weathertop</li>
          <li>Rivendell</li>
          <li>Mines of Moria</li>
          <li>Lothlorien</li>
          <li>Emyn Muil</li>
          <li>Dead Marshes</li>
          <li>Ithilien</li>
          <li>Shelob's Lair</li>
          <li>Cirith Ungol</li>
          <li>Mount Doom</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h4>On Your Turn</h4>
        <p>
          On your turn, you will be asked a trivia question. Answer correctly to
          advance to the next game board space. Play passes between players
          after each question.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Winning the Game</h4>
        <p>
          When a player advances to the final board space (Mount Doom), play
          does not pass to the next player. Instead, the player in the final
          space has a chase to win the game with one final question. If the
          question is answered correctly, the game is over! If not, play passes
          to the next player until someone ends the game by correctly answering
          a question in the Mount Doom game board space.
        </p>
